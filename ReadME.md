## Tips For A Good Usable Website
1. Use acceptable conventions
   * Logo positioned at top left
   * Navigation across the top or down the left side
   * Copyright in the footer.
2. Visual hierarchy
   * Most important information is the most prominent
3. Break pages up into defined sections
   * Logically related content should be related visually
4. That which is clickable should be obviously clickable.
5. Eliminate distractions
   * Use only two typefaces
   * Limit color pallet (3 colors with black and white)
   * Use a grid
6. Support scanning (users don't read)
   * Use plenty of headings
   * Short paragraphs
   * Bulleted lists
   * Left aligned text
7. Strive for consistency.
8. Use semantic and valid HTML: validator at [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/).
